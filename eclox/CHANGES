	the build job has finished.

	Refactored the code so that the core doxygen API is splitted from
	the ui implementation. And a branding plugin has been added.

	brings improved output logging (now based on the eclipse's console
	API) and control over build jobs.
	
	Fix bug #5719 : double quote escapes in setting values.
	Now it is possible for settings to support escaped quotes in their value
	when splitting. The ui part is now able to handle double quotes (un)escapes
	transparently and automatically. The user now interacts with the unescaped
	string version. When the edited string returns back to the doxyfile, it is
	automatically escaped. A preference allows the user to deactivate this
	bahviour (default is on).
	
	Some icons have been updated (doxyfile, clear custom filter field and
	doxygen build action).
	
	Now an editor automatically closes when its related doxyfile gets deleted
	from the workspace.

	removal for example).
