eclox-0.1.4 (in progress):
    o One more improvement of the tag edition.
    
eclox-0.1.3 (03-may-2004):
    o The tag edition has been improved. While editing a tag, hitting ESC
      cancels the current edition, at the opposite, hitting ENTER completes
      the current edition.
    o The doxygen creation wizard has been fixed to support pathes with and
      without spaces under *nix.
    o The default doxygen command string match the exact *nix syntax, since
      those OS are case-sensitive.
    o In the doxyfile editor, the tag name column adjusts to the longest name.
    o Hints of the selected tag reactivated.
    o Deactivated the boolean field of the editor since the behaviour was not
      very handy.

eclox-0.1.2 (23-feb-2004):
    o A brand new doxfile loader supporting files generated by various
      tools (like DoxWizard). Fixes bugs #241 and #245.
    o Creation of the change log file (this file).

eclox-0.1.1:
    o Margins arround the editor controls has been removed. Spacing between
      these controls has been decreased to 1 pixel. Look's nicer. 
    o Now, filenames that are recognized by the plugin contain either the
      "doxyfile" string as base name or as extension.

eclox-0.1.0:
    o Code name set to 'bombarde'.
    o First available version.
