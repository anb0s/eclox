   page.

   reactivated if the selected filter was not changing.
 * Fix bug #8593 : Editor hangs up when entering "custom" filter.
   The "text" property of a setting was missing and thus a null
   pointer was received while filtering the setting view. This null
   pointer was not well handled.
 * Fix bug #7276 : Problems with adding HTML-formatted aliases. 
   Double-quotes and backslashes should be escapd well by now.

eclox-0.5.1 (20-may-2006)
 * Fix a bug in the directory browser dialog that caused the initial path
   to be invalid in some conditions.

   bad type for STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH.
 * Fix wrong type for setting EXPAND_AS_DEFINED.
 * Refactored the code so that the core doxygen API is splitted from
   the ui implementation. And a branding plugin has been added.
 * The documentation building API has been deeply refactored. This 
   brings improved output logging (now based on the eclipse's console
   API) and control over build jobs.
 * Fix bug #5719 : double quote escapes in setting values.
   Now it is possible for settings to support escaped quotes in their
   value when splitting. The ui part is now able to handle double 
   quotes (un)escapes transparently and automatically. The user now 
   interacts with the unescaped string version. When the edited string 
   returns back to the doxyfile, it is automatically escaped. 
   A preference allows the user to deactivate this bahviour (default 
   is on).
 * Some icons have been updated (doxyfile, clear custom filter field and
   doxygen build action).
 * Now an editor automatically closes when its related doxyfile gets 
   deleted from the workspace.
 * In the list editor, the focus management has been improved (after item
   removal for example).
