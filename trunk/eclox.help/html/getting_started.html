<h1>Getting Started</h1>


<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Once the plugin installed, you must ensure that the default PATH environment
variable makes the doxygen binary reachable for the plugin. If not, you can
update PATH to include to directory containing the Doxygen binary, or you can
tell Eclox where that binary is located on your system (which is in my opinion
the better solution). To do this, open Eclipse's preference edition dialog
window and go into the new "Doxygen" section.</p>
 

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You can create new Doxygen projects (also called doxyfiles) using the 
creation wizard. Go to "File->New->Other->Other->Doxygen Configuration". Press
next and set both file location and name. Then a empty doxyfile will be
created at the specified location, the wizard automatically adds the
".Doxyfile" extension.</p>

<p>You should now see a file with a yellow question mark icon. This is your new
doxyfile. Double-clicking on it will open the editor. You can now browse and
edit the settings.</p>
 
<p>Once your have properly set all doxyfile fields, you can launch a
documentation build using the toolbar icon showing a yellow question mark. In 
the case the button is not visible in the toolbar, your current perspective
needs to get configured. Go to "Window->Customize perspective->Commands" and
in "Available command groups" check "Doxygen". Additionnaly, you can browse
the latest builds by clicking the down arrow right to the toolbar button.</p>

<p>When the documentation build starts, a new view showing the build log opens.
In its toolbar, a button named "Stop" allows you to halt the current build
process. The current build also appears in the Eclipse job progress view and
you can control the job from there.</p>
 
<p>The build toolbar action determine the next doxyfile to build depending on
the current active workbench part (editor or view) and the current selection
in that part. For example, if the active part is a doxyfile editor, the next
doxyfile to build will be the one being edited. If the active part is the
resource explorer and the current selection is a doxyfile, that doxyfile will
be next to get build. In the case the active part selection doesn't correspond
to a doxyfile, the last built doxyfile will be rebuiled. And if the build
history is empty, you will be asked for the doxyfile to build.</p>
