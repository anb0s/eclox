          Eclox, a Doxygen frontend plugin for Eclipse.
                <http://gna.org/projects/eclox>


1. INSTALLATION

  To install this plugin, follow the common installation procedure consisting
 in copying the whole plugin folder into Eclise's plugin folder. For
 additionnal details, please refer to Eclipse's documentation.

2. CONFIGURATION

  Once the plugin installed, you must ensure that the default PATH environment
 variable makes the doxygen binary reachable for the plugin. If not, you can
 update PATH to include to directory containing the Doxygen binary, or you can
 tell Eclox where that binary is located on your system (which is in my opinion
 the better solution). To do this, open Eclipse's preference edition dialog
 window and go into the new "Doxygen" section.
 
3. USAGE

  You can create new Doxygen projects (also called doxyfiles) using the 
 creation wizard. Go to "File->New->Other->Other->Doxygen Configuration". Press
 next and set both file location and name. Then a empty doxyfile will be
 created at the specified location, the wizard automatically adds the
 ".Doxyfile" extension.

  You should now see a file with a yellow question mark icon. This is your new
 doxyfile. Double-clicking on it will open the editor. You can now browse and
 edit the settings.
 
  Once your have properly set all doxyfile fields, you can launch a
 documentation build using the toolbar icon showing a yellow question mark. In 
 the case the button is not visible in the toolbar, your current perspective
 needs to get configured. Go to "Window->Customize perspective->Commands" and
 in "Available command groups" check "Doxygen".

  When the documentation build starts, a new view showing the build log opens.
 In its toolbar, a button named "Stop" allows you to halt the current build
 process.
