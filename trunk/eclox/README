Help:
-----

To install this plugin, follow the common installation procedure consisting in
copying the whole plugin folder into Eclise's plugin folder. For additionnal
details, please refer to Eclise's documentation.

You must ensure that Doxygen's binary is reachable in the current path. If not,
you can update the path. Another and better solution is to specify the plugin
where Doxygen's binary is located. To do this, open Eclipse's preference
edition dialog window and go into the new "Doxygen" section.

You can now create an empty Doxygen file, using the creation wizard.
Go to File->New->Other->Other->Doxygen Configuration. Press next and enter
both file location and name.

Eclox automatically recognize any file having ".cfg" extension as a possible
Doxygen configuration file. When a file as been recognized as a Doxygen 
configuration, its icon shows a yellow question mark.

Double-clicking on a doxygen configuration file will open the editor. Notice
the new taskbar action that appeared (its icon shows the same yellow question
mark as the file's one). That action launches the Doxygen build using the
configuration file being edited.

When using the contextual menu on a recognized Doxygen configuration file, 
you will see a new action called "Build Documentation". This launches the 
doxygen documentation build process. While building, all Doxygen messages
will be logged in a view called "Doxygen Build Log".
