eclox-0.10.1 (15-oct-2013)

Applied patch to fix some typo in help.


eclox-0.10.0 (7-juil-2013)

New release of eclox distributed under EPL 1.0 (to allow debian packaging).


eclox-0.8.1

FIX bug #12915 : Misspelling in Doxyfile Editor.


eclox-0.8.0 (17-oct-2008)

New release of eclox, for eclipse 3.3+ ! Release 0.8.0 integrates all features
and fixes done in 0.7.x releases.


eclox-0.7.3 (28-mai-2008)

ADD task #5974 : Automatic doxyfile creation when clicking the "build" action.
    When the user wants to build a doxyfile but none exists in the opened
    resource, it gets prompt to create a new doxyfile.

ADD task #4841 : Allow the user to configure the doxygen binary to use
    when doxygen invocation fails. This may occur when building or
    creating a doxyfile. A dialog asks the user to edit the preferences
    and shows the appropriate preference page when applicable.

FIX bug #11598 : Editor crashes when looking for certain tags. Depending
    on doxygen version used to generated a doxyfile, some expected tags
    may not be defined. Now the editor disables user interface controls
    related to missing tags.

FIX bug #10595 : NullPointerException while opening Doxyfile editor.
    See bug #11598.


eclox-0.7.2 (29-apr-2008)

FIX bug #10720 : Browsing for input folders. When adding an input folder
    entry and browsing for the where the doxyfile lies, the path was empty.
    Empty relative paths are now substituted with ".".

ADD task #5722 : Remember selected doxyfile for building across eclipse
    restarts. Now the history of build doxyfiles is saved when eclipse
    shuts down and restore on start.


eclox-0.7.1 (16-dec-2007)
 * bug #9693 : Bad console output when several workbench windows are open.
   This bug was the opportunity for a deep refactoring of the doxygen
   build console management. Now each doxyfile build job has its own
   console instance, each console is now able to create several console
   pages. As a result, console pages (displayed in the same workbench
   window or not) that point to the same console will show the same
   output.

eclox-0.7.0 (8-dec-2007)
 * Creation of the hot update site, that provides latest eclox versions
   that are still in development.
 * task #4859 : Enhance the error reporting when doxygen invokation fails
   in the doxyfile creation wizard. When doxygen was not found, the user
   gets asked for preference edition, or not. When wanted, the preference
   dialog gets opened and the user can configure eclox to find doxygen.
   If changes gets validated, the doxyfile generation is started again,
   it is canceled otherwise.
 * task #5609 : Update README file. Changed
   "yellow question mark" by "@-sign in blue".
 * task #5524 : Workspace refresh after documentation builds.
   Once a doxygen build is finished, the resource container that
   received the documentation output is refreshed.

eclox-0.6.5 (1-oct-2007)
 * bug #10074 : Right clicking on a closed project causes an Eclox error.
   Searching for doxyfiles into a closed project was not handled and
   ended in an exception. Thanks to slide_o_mix for the report.

eclox-0.6.4 (19-sep-2007)
 * task #5127 : Use content types for the contextual build menu and
   for the editor. Contextual menu build action gets enhanced. It
   either launch doxygen when the selection is a doxyfile, prompt
   for a doxyfile to build when the selection contains doxyfiles
   or disables otherwise.
 * sr #1604 : Specially named doxyfiles. It is now possible to define
   custom doxyfile name and extensions.
 * task #5406 : Support new doxygen 1.5.3 settings
 * task #5405 : Bundle all windows and linux doxygen till 1.5.3
 * task #5251 : Support new settings of doxygen 1.5.2
 * task #4978 : Add navigation history in the advanced editor page.
 * Fixes bug #6024 : Multiple markers, entries in build history when
   building the same doxyfile from two perspectives.

eclox-0.6.3 (24-apr-2007)
 * Fixes bug #8976 : Eclipse 3.2.2 (M20070212-1330) Can not create
   Doxyfile. The selection was expected to have the IResource interface.
   Now, when no IResource interface is found for the current selection,
   eclox tries to find an adapter to get it.

eclox-0.6.2 (4-apr-2007)
 * Implements task #4978 : Add navigation history in the advanced editor
   page.
 * Fixes bug #8844 : Doxyfile Editor does not work with Version 0.6.1
   on Eclipse 3.2.2.

eclox-0.6.1 (1-apr-2007)
 * task #3126 : Enhance the doxyfile creation wizard. Initialize the
   new doxyfile name with the enclosing eclipse project.
 * task #4863 : Enhance the note for settings in the advanced editor
   page. Now layout and formatting are done in setting notes.
   Their are also hyperlinks to related settings, allowing a faster
   navigation.
 * task #4938 : Add resource decoration on doxyfiles being built.
 * task #4840 : Enhance the doxyfile editor with a new "overview" page.
 * Fixes bug #5983 : TAGFILES note missing. Since the enhancement of
   the setting note presentation, the note of this setting could be
   added.
 * Fixes bug #8809 : Wrong text for the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag.
 * Fixes bug #8819 : In advanced editor page, selection change not shown.

eclox-0.6.0 (1-mar-2007)
 * Add setting properties for REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE.
 * Fix bug #8599 : Frozen doxyfile editor when clicking twice on a
   filter buttonWhen updating the user interface controls,
   redraw was disabled to avoid flickering. Redraw was not
   reactivated if the selected filter was not changing.
 * Fix bug #8593 : Editor hangs up when entering "custom" filter.
   The "text" property of a setting was missing and thus a null
   pointer was received while filtering the setting view. This null
   pointer was not well handled.
 * Fix bug #7276 : Problems with adding HTML-formatted aliases.
   Double-quotes and backslashes should be escapd well by now.
 * Add support for packaged doxygen binaries. Currently, only x86 windows
   and x86 linux are supported.
 * Add new feature allowing a user to specify one or more doxygen binary
   location.
 * Add new feature that detects any doxygen found in the path.


eclox-0.5.5 (13-dec-2006)
 * Fix bug #7545 : "Save all editors before building" settings isn't
   preserved correctly across Eclipse restarts. A bad string equality
   test was used ("==" instead of "equals").
 * Add sr #1296 : Marking finish of doxygen. A message is printed once
   the build job has finished.
 * Fix bug #7342 : Setting IGNORE_PREFIX is handled wrong. Changed
   boolean for text list.


eclox-0.5.4 (05-sep-2006)
 * Fix bug #6740 : jar declared in classpath is missing.
 * Fix bug #6795 : unable to edit doxygen preferences.

   file.
 * Fix two bugs (#5979 and #5981) on java VMs 1.4.2 since the released
   plugins where targeted for java 1.5.


eclox-0.5.1 (20-may-2006)
 * Fix a bug in the directory browser dialog that caused the initial path
   to be invalid in some conditions.
 * Added build log analysis. So now problem reported by doxygen are
   converted to markers on files. This will help to find and fix
   mistakes in documentation blocks.
 * Fix the build options so the feature's about.ini is included. So now
   the feature description is available from ecllipse's about box.
 * Removed deprecated icons from the branding plugin.


eclox-0.5.0 (16-may-2006)
 * Fix bug #5700. "Generate Tag File" was not using the right editor
   (was "boolean" and should have been "file").
 * Fix bug #5927 : strip From Path option is incorrect. Also fixes
   bad type for STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH.
 * Fix wrong type for setting EXPAND_AS_DEFINED.
 * Refactored the code so that the core doxygen API is splitted from
   the ui implementation. And a branding plugin has been added.
 * The documentation building API has been deeply refactored. This
   brings improved output logging (now based on the eclipse's console
   API) and control over build jobs.
 * Fix bug #5719 : double quote escapes in setting values.
   Now it is possible for settings to support escaped quotes in their
   value when splitting. The ui part is now able to handle double
   quotes (un)escapes transparently and automatically. The user now
   interacts with the unescaped string version. When the edited string
   returns back to the doxyfile, it is automatically escaped.
   A preference allows the user to deactivate this bahviour (default
   is on).
 * Some icons have been updated (doxyfile, clear custom filter field and
   doxygen build action).
 * Now an editor automatically closes when its related doxyfile gets
   deleted from the workspace.
 * In the list editor, the focus management has been improved (after item
   removal for example).


eclox-0.4.4 (08-mar-2006)

   the edition controls.

   doxyfile is saved.
 * In the editor, a "modified" filter has been added allowing to see only
   modified settings. Enhanced the setting property API to provide
   better notifications. Also enhanced the editor page refresh when
   switching from one filter to another.
 * In the editor, added support for directory path editor. Updated the
   editor type for following settings: HTML_OUTPUT, LATEX_OUTPUT,
   RTF_OUTPUT, MAN_OUTPUT, XML_OUTPUT and OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.
 * In the editor, added support for file path editor. Updated the editor
   type for following settings: INPUT_FILTER, HTML_HEADER, HTML_FOOTER,
   HTML_STYLESHEET, CHM_FILE, HCC_LOCATION, LATEX_HEADER, XML_SCHEMA,
   XML_DTD, PERL_PATH, DOT_PATH, FILE_VERSION_FILTER, WARN_LOGFILE.
 * In the editor, added support for list, directory list, and
   file/directory list editors. Updated the setting definitions of
   ALIASES, FILE_PATTERNS, EXCLUDE_PATTERNS, EXAMPLE_PATTERNS,
   INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS, PREDEFINED, INPUT, EXCLUDE, EXAMPLE_PATH,
   IMAGE_PATH to use these editors.
 * Updated the default editor icon.

 * Deep refactoring of the doxyfile content representation.
 * Recreation of the doxyfile editor using new ui APIs provided since
